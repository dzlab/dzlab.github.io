I recently passed Google Professional Developer Certification, during the preparation I went throught lot resources about the exam. I also used this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Cloud-Certified-Professional-Developer/dp/1800560990) which is a good read and covers most of the exam topics. It is very good starting point for the preparation if you have little knowledge on Google Cloud services.

> Keep in mind that Google update its services very often, thus any source of information other than the official documentation may become out dated.

The exam is relatively at the same difficulty level of the Data engineer certification exam:
- It is recommended to have at least 3 years of industry experience with at least 1 years using GCP.
- The format of the exam is Multiple choice quesitons, to be finished within 2h.
- You can take the exam in person at a test center.
- One difference, is the exam has 60 questions instead of the typical 50.

The exman focuses on the following areas:
- Storage
- Databases
- Compute
- Networking
- DevOps

I could not find a comprehensive resource that covers all aspect of the exam when I started preparing. I had to go over a lot of Google Cloud products page and general Machine Learning resources and at no point I felt ready as both topics are huge. Here I will try to provide a summary of the resources I did found helpful for passing the exam.


## Certification SWAG
After passing the exam, you can choose one of the official certification swags:
