There are lot of libraries that makes it easy to develop concurrent applications on the JVM, most notably Akka that uses the Actor model. 

In fact, Akka actors can be used to solve a lot of challenges, but they also have high implications:
- Requires modeling the application in terms of actors and their interactions in terms of message passing
  - Leads to complex code as everything in the application is an Actor
  - Requires creating a hierarchy of classes representing the commands that every actor can handle
- Needs coupling between source/destination by passing around an `ActorRef` to send messages
- Testing is not straightforward as you need to send message and block till actor respond then assert, sometimes timeout happens which leads to unstable tests
- In general implies partial functions, mutability, special messaging syntax, supervision strategies, lifecycle management, actor systems, defining messaging protocols. 

Alternatively to Akka, other libraries provides concurrency primitives that can be used to achieve similar functionality. For instance ZIO/Cats Effect, which in addition to make developing concurrent applications easy and because they are purely functional they also provide improved type safety, immutability, and purity.

Here are some interesting talks about moving away from Akka Actor to more functional alternatives:
- Replacing Actors with Cats Effect and FS2 - [article link](https://www.signifytechnology.com/blog/2019/10/replacing-akka-actors-with-cats-effect-and-fs2-by-viktor-lovgren)
- Moving from Akka to ZIO - [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvaO62TD8L0)

Choosing between ZIO and Cats Effect depends on your taste of functional programing. For more details on the comparison between the two libraries you can check the following Redit thread about evolving to ZIO or Cats Effects - [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/scala/comments/ipbprf/evolving_to_zio_or_cats_effects/).

In Short:
- Cats Effect seems to be purely functional as it is based on ideas from Haskell
- ZIO is simpler and is object-oriented in addition to be functional 
  - ZIO effects are scala Future but ++ (they are an execution plan)
  - ZLayer makes it easy to follow OOP modularity principles

In the rest of this article we will focus on ZIO and the features it provides:

## Modularity with ZIO

See https://scalac.io/ebook/mastering-modularity-in-zio-with-zlayer/a-deep-look-into-the-zio-module-structure/

### Modularity with ZIO 1.0 
#### Service A
```scala
// define service
trait ServiceA {
  def process(input: String): IO[ErrorType, OutputType]
}
// implement service
final case class ServiceAImpl() extends ServiceA {
  def process(input: String): IO[ErrorType, OutputType] = … // business logic here
}
// lift this Service Implementation into a ZLayer
object ServiceAImpl {
  val layer: ULayer[Has[ServiceA]] = (ServiceAImpl.apply _).toLayer
}
```

See https://scalac.io/ebook/mastering-modularity-in-zio-with-zlayer/implementing-the-tic-tac-toe-application/

#### Service C depends on A and B

```scala
// define service
trait ServiceC {
  def process(input: String): IO[ErrorType, OutputType]
}
// implement service B that depends on Service A and B
final case class ServiceCImpl(a: ServiceA, b: ServiceB) extends ServiceC {
  def process(input: String): IO[ErrorType, OutputType] = … // business logic here
}
// lift this Service Implementation into a ZLayer
object ServiceCImpl {
  val layer: URLayer[Has[ServiceA] with Has[ServiceB], Has[ServiceC]] = (ServiceCImpl(_, _)).toLayer
}
```

```scala
// How to use the services to create a ZIO effect
object ServiceC {
  def processWithA(input: String): ZIO[Has[ServiceA], ErrorType, OutputType] = ZIO.serviceWith[ServiceA](_.parse(input))
  def processWithC(input: String): ZIO[Has[ServiceC], ErrorType, OutputType] = ZIO.serviceWith[ServiceC](_.parse(input))
}
```

### Modularity with ZIO 2.0

Examples with ZIO 2.0

- 



## Asynchronous / Asynchronous with ZIO effects

```scala
// Synchronous code can be converted into a ZIO effect using ZIO.attempt:
val readLine: ZIO[Any, Throwable, String] = ZIO.attempt(StdIn.readLine())

// ZIO has a blocking thread pool built into the runtime, and To execute effects there with ZIO.blocking or:
val sleeping = ZIO.attemptBlocking(Thread.sleep(Long.MaxValue))

// Asynchronous code that exposes a callback-based API can be converted into a ZIO effect using ZIO.async:
object legacy {
  def login(onSuccess: User => Unit, onFailure: AuthError => Unit): Unit = ???
}
val login: ZIO[Any, AuthError, User] = ZIO.async[Any, AuthError, User] { callback =>
  legacy.login( user => callback(ZIO.succeed(user)), err  => callback(ZIO.fail(err)) )
}
```

## Concurrency with ZIO fibers

```scala
// concurrency with fork and join which returns the fiber success/fail
for {
  fiber   <- ZIO.succeed("Hi!").fork // forking an effect creates a fiber from current one
  message <- fiber.join // join this fiber with main one
} yield message

// concurrency with fork and await which returns Exit value (information on how the fiber completed)
for {
  fiber   <- ZIO.succeed("Hi!").fork // forking an effect creates a fiber from current one
  exit <- fiber.await // join this fiber with main one
} yield exit
```

## Resources with ZIO
### Old way with ZManaged

```scala
// managing resources using ZManaged (old way)
def file(name: String): ZManaged[Any, Throwable, File] = ???
file(name).use { file =>
 ???
}
// composition of ZManaged resources
for {
 file1 <- file(path1)
 file2 <- file(path2)
} yield (file1, file2)
```

### New way with Scope

```scala
// managing resources using dynamic Scopes (new way)
def file(path: String): ZIO[Scope, Throwable, File] = ???
ZIO.scoped {
 file(path).flatMap(useFile)
}
// composition of ZIO with scope
for {
 file1 <- file(path1)
 file2 <- file(path2)
} yield (file1, file2)
```

## ZIO SQL

- Type safe: catch errors in the query at compile, e.g. syntax errors
- SQL-like DSL: feels like writing sql
- ZIO integration: you get a ZIO effect
- Connection, session, resource and transactional management
- More

Although
- It is relatively new
- Supports only postgres

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJHiMa3MDbI

Also for quill https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIu6YH2DVZM

```scala
// insert
insertInto(persons)(id ++ name ++ age).values(List((1, "Charles", 30), (2, "Martin", 28), (3, "Harvey", 42)))


// join
select(firstName ++ orderDate).from(customers.join(orders).on(id === customerId))

// subqueries
val subquery = customers.subselect(Count(orderId)).from(orders).where(customerId === id)
val query = select(fName ++ lName ++ (subquery as "Count")).from(customers)
```
